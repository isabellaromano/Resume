  <h1>"What I'm suggesting to you is that this could be a renaissance. We may be on the cusp of a future which could provide a tremendous leap forward for humanity" <br />-Jeremy Rifkin</h1>
  <p>I study Global Studies and Sustainable Development because I believe exactly that. With the right mix of technology, policy and ethics we could be on the cusp of something great. We are nearing a future that could be based on renewable energy, diverse communities and equal opportunity. And I can't wait to be a part of it.</p>
